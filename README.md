edx2bigquery
============

edx2bigquery is a tool for importing edX SQL and log data into Google
BigQuery for research and analysis. It requires python 2.7.

Read more about it in [this writeup](https://vpal.harvard.edu/blog/demystifying-educational-mooc-data-using-google-bigquery-person-course-dataset-part-1) by the Harvard University Office of the Vice Provost for Advances in Learning, and the article "[Google BigQuery for Education: Framework for Parsing and Analyzing edX MOOC Data](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=3051457.3053980)", by Glenn Lopez, Daniel Seaton, Andrew Ang, Dustin Tingley, and Isaac Chuang.

## Getting Started

To get started, install the Google Cloud SDK first:

  https://cloud.google.com/sdk/

Then generate authentication tokens using "gcloud auth login". Make sure
that "bq" and "gsutil" work properly.

To install:

  python setup.py develop

Also, setup the file edx2bigquery_config.py in your current working directory.  Example:

    #-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    #
    # sample edx2bigquery_config.py file
    #
    course_id_list = [
            "MITx/2.03x/3T2013",
    ]

    courses = {
        'year2': course_id_list,
        'all_harvardx': [
            "HarvardX/AI12.1x/2013_SOND",
        ],
    }

    # google cloud project access
    auth_key_file = "USE_GCLOUD_AUTH"
    auth_service_acct = None

    # google bigquery config
    PROJECT_ID = "x-data"

    # google cloud storage
    GS_BUCKET = "gs://x-data"

    # local file configuration
    COURSE_SQL_BASE_DIR = "X-Year-1-data-sql"
    COURSE_SQL_DATE_DIR = '2013-09-08'
    TRACKING_LOGS_DIRECTORY = "TRACKING_LOGS"

    #-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

To run:

  edx2bigquery

positional arguments:
  command               A variety of commands are available, each with different arguments:

                        --- TOP LEVEL COMMANDS

                        setup_sql <course_id> ...   : Do all commands (make_uic, sql2bq, load_forum) to get edX SQL data into the right format, upload to
                                                      google storage, and import into BigQuery.  See more information about each of those commands, below.
                                                      This step is idempotent - it can be re-run multiple times, and the result should not change.
                                                      Returns when all uploads and imports are completed.

                                                      Accepts the "--year2" flag, to process all courses in the config file's course_id_list.

                                                      Accepts the --dataset-latest flag, to use the latest directory date in the SQL data directory.
                                                      Directories should be named YYYY-MM-DD.  When this flag is used, the course SQL dataset name has
                                                      "_latest" appended to it.

                                                      Also accepts the "--clist=XXX" option, to specify which list of courses to act upon.

                                                      Before running this command, make sure your SQL files are converted and formatted according to the
                                                      "Waldo" convention established by Harvard.  Use the "waldofy" command (see below) for this,
                                                      if necessary.

                        daily_logs --tlfn=<path>    : Do all commands (split, logs2gs, logs2bq) to get one day's edX tracking logs into google storage
                                   <course_id>        and import into BigQuery.  See more information about each of those commands, below.
                                   ...                This step is idempotent - it can be re-run multiple times, and the result should not change.
                                                      Returns when all uploads and imports are completed.

                                                      Accepts the "--year2" flag, to process all courses in the config file's course_id_list.

                        doall <course_id> ...       : run setup_sql, analyze_problems, logs2gs, logs2bq, axis2bq, person_day, enrollment_day,
                                                      person_course, and problem_check for each of the specified courses.  This is idempotent, and can be run
                                                      weekly when new SQL dumps come in.

                        nightly <course_id> ...     : Run sequence of commands for common nightly update (based on having new tracking logs available).
                                                      This includes logs2gs, logs2bq, person_day, enrollment_day, person_course (forced recompute),
                                                      and problem_check.

                        --external command <cid>... : Run external command on data from one or more course_id's.  Also uses the --extparam settings.
                                                      External commands are defined in edx2bigquery_config.  Use --skiprun to create the external script
                                                      without running.  Use --submit-condor to submit command as a condor job.

                        --- SQL DATA RELATED COMMANDS

                        waldofy <sql_data_dir>      : Apply HarvardX Jim Waldo conventions to SQL data as received from edX, which renames files to be
                                <course_id> ...       more user friendly (e.g. courseware_studentmodule -> studentmodule) and converts the tab-separated
                                                      values form (*.sql) to comma-separated values (*.csv).  Also compresses the resulting csv files.
                                                      Does this only for the specified course's, because the edX SQL dump may contain a bunch of
                                                      uknown courses, or scratch courses from the edge site, which should not be co-mingled with
                                                      course data from the main production site.

                                                      It is assumed that <sql_data_dir> has a name which contains a date, e.g. xorg-2014-05-11 ;
                                                      the resulting data are put into the course SQL base directory, into a subdirectory with
                                                      name given by the course_id and date, YYYY-MM-DD.

                                                      The SQL files from edX must already be decrypted (not *.gpg), before running this command.

                                                      Be sure to specify which course_id's to act upon.  Courses which are not explicitly specified
                                                      are put in a subdirectory named "UNKNOWN".

                        sql2bq <course_id> ...      : load specified course_id SQL files into google storage, and import the user_info_combo and studentmodule
                                                      data into BigQuery.
                                                      Also upload course_image.jpg images from the course SQL directories (if image exists) to
                                                      google storage, and make them public-read.
                                                      Accepts the "--year2" flag, to process all courses in the config file's course_id_list.

                        load_forum <course_id> ...  : Rephrase the forum.mongo data from the edX SQL dump, to fit the schema used for forum
                                                      data in the course BigQuery tables.  Saves this to google storage, and imports into BigQuery.
                                                      Accepts the "--year2" flag, to process all courses in the config file's course_id_list.

                        makegeoip                   : Creates table of geoip information for IP addresses in person_course table missing country codes.

                                                      Alternatively, provide the --org argument to specify the course_report_ORG dataset to look
                                                      in for the latest person_course dataset.

                        tsv2csv                     : filter, which takes lines of tab separated values and outputs lines of comma separated values.
                                                      Useful when processing the *.sql files from edX dumps.

                        mongo2user_info <course_id> : dump users, profiles, enrollment, certificates CSV files from mongodb for specified course_id's.
                                                      Use this to address missing users issue in pre-early-2014 edX course dumps, which had the problem
                                                      that learners who un-enrolled were removed from the enrollment table.

                        --- TRACKING LOG DATA RELATED COMMANDS

                        split <daily_log_file> ...  : split single-day tracking log files (should be named something like mitx-edx-events-2014-10-17.log.gz),
                                                      which have aleady been decrypted, into DIR/<course>/tracklog-YYYY-MM-DD.json.gz for each course_id.
                                                      The course_id is determined by parsing each line of the tracking log.  Each line is also
                                                      rephrased such that it is consistent with the tracking log schema defined for import
                                                      into BigQuery.  For example, "event" is turned into a string, and "event_struct" is created
                                                      as a parsed JSON dict for certain event_type values.  Also, key names cannot contain
                                                      dashes or periods.  Uses --logs-dir option, or, failing that, TRACKING_LOGS_DIRECTORY in the
                                                      edx2bigquery_config file.  Employs DIR/META/* files to keep track of which log files have been
                                                      split and rephrased, such that this command's actions are idempotent.

                        logs2gs <course_id> ...     : transfer compressed daily tracking log files for the specified course_id's to Google cloud storage.
                                                      Does NOT import the log data into BigQuery.
                                                      Accepts the "--year2" flag, to process all courses in the config file's course_id_list.

                        logs2bq <course_id> ...     : import daily tracking log files for the specified course_id's to BigQuery, from Google cloud storage.
                                                      The import jobs are queued; this does not wait for the jobs to complete,
                                                      before exiting.
                                                      Accepts the "--year2" flag, to process all courses in the config file's course_id_list.

                        mongo2gs <course_id> ...    : extract tracking logs from mongodb (using mongoexport) for the specified course_id and upload to google storage.
                                                      uses the --start-date and --end-date options.  Skips dates for which the correspnding file in google storage
                                                      already exists.
                                                      Rephrases log file entries to be consistent with the schema used for tracking log file data in BigQuery.
                                                      Accepts the "--year2" flag, to process all courses in the config file's course_id_list.

                        course_key_version <cid>    : print out what version of course key (standard, v1) is being used for a given course_id.  Needed for opaque key
                                                      handling.  The "standard" course_id format is "org/course/semester".  The opaque-key v1 format is
                                                      "course-v1:org+course+semester".  Opaque keys also mangle what is known as a the "module_id", and
                                                      use something like "block-v1:MITx+8.MechCx_2+2T2015+type@problem+block@Blocks_on_Ramp_randxyzBILNKOA0".
                                                      The opaque key ID's are changed back into the standard format, in most of the parsing of the SQL
                                                      and the tracking logs (see addmoduleid.py), but it's still necessary to know which kind of key
                                                      is being used, e.g. do that jump_to_id will work properly when linking back to a live course page.
                                                      course_id is always stored in tradition format.  course_key is kept in either standard or v1 opaque key
                                                      format.  module_id is always standard, and kept as "org/course/<module_type>/<module_id>".  In
                                                      the future, there may be a module_key, but that idea isn't currently used.  This particular command
                                                      scans some tracking log entries, and if the count of "block-v1" is high, it assigns "v1"
                                                      to the course; otherwise, it assigns "standard" as the course key version.

                        grade_reports <course_id>   : request and download the latest edx instructor grade report from the edx instructor dashboards.
                                                      For courses that are self-paced/on-demand, edX does not provide grades for non-verified ID users.
                                                      To fix this issue, this function was created to grab the latest grades for all users from the grade report
                                                      in the edX instructor dashboard. This requires the following updates to the following:

                        analyze_content             : construct "course_content" table, which counts the number of xmodules of different categories,
                            --listings listings.csv   and also the length of the course in weeks (based on using the listings file).
                            <course_id> ...           Use this for categorizing a course according to the kind of content it has.
